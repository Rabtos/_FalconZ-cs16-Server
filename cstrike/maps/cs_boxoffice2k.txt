It is the long-awaited premiere opening of the latest action packed movie "DEADLOCK".
Hollywood's most glamorous actors and actresses have converged upon a 5-star theater 
to both "be seen" and to see the promising motion picture. The media and paparazzi 
have lined the red carpet, snapping pictures and whoring for interviews. Security is
tight.... but not tight enough: a terrorist faction has infiltrated the theater! 
With the intentions of kidnapping several "A-list" actors, the group has battered 
down a wall of the theater with their van. The terrorists, wielding automatic weapons,
have overtaken the theater and are demanding millions in ransom in exchange
for the release of their famous hostages. The decision has been made that
there is to be no negotiations with the faction. An elite counter-terrorism
force is about to arrive on the scene, and a fierce battle appears eminent. 

Counter-terrorist your mission:
You team has gathered in a theater on the opposing side of the building. Coordinate
a team effort to secure the movie complex and avoid hostage casualty. Beware the
terrorist may already know of your presence, move quickly. A safety zone is located at
the theaters' box-office.

Terrorist you mission:
Guard all entrances to the movie complex. Hold movie stars hostage to receive ransom 
for the popular actors.
