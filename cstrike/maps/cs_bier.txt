|BIER| - Hostage Rescue
by KwakkaSaki (ErikN@home.nl)

[Background Information]
The year is 2001,
A group of unknown Terrorists often refered to as
"The Bier Clan" have arrived in Durham City. The
Terrorist took over an entire neighbourhood. Most
citizens are escaped. But an unknown number of
citizens are still in the neighbourhood. They're
most likely hiding in some buildings.

[Terrorists]
Kidnapp the citizens and prevent the Counter-
Terrorists from rescueing them.

[Counter-Terrorists]
Find and escort the 3 people to a safe location in
Durham City before the T's get to them. Otherwise
you'll have to deal with the Terrorists first.
