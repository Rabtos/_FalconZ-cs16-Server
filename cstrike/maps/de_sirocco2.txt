Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing water access and defense 
equipment.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten targeted areas.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must locate and destroy a small number
of special ops equipment stores. This 
equipment is identified with "medical" 
markings which have been used to conceal the 
true contents.  

Other Notes: Intelligence has uncovered 
information concerning one of the suspected 
bomb targets, a light goods bridge.
