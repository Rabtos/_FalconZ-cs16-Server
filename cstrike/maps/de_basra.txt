Basra - Defusion
by Jan 'c4stor' Weber 

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the Terrorists from
bombing the swimming pool or the warehouse of Basra.

Terrorists: Destroy the local goods or bomb 
the pride of Basra, the swimming pool.

Other Notes: 
There are 2 bomb sites in this mission.
Keep an eye on the market.

I must admit that the r_speeds are very high in some areas of the map
This is my first bigger map but I think it's pretty well done.
