An ancient and lost temple has been found.
Archeologists discovered a great secret
and are about to put the pieces together.

Terrorists: Use the C4 to destroy one of
the artifact puzzles the archeologists
have already secured on A or B.

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent terrorists
from bombing the secured artifacts.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten targeted areas.
