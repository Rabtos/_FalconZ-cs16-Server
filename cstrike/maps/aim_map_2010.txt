aim_map_2010 - aim training map

The 2010 year version of popular aim_map.
Whats new?
Fixed:

* Visual bugs;
* Player die on spawn. Now players won't die
on spawn when player count is big (for example
full team (16 players) won't die);
* Bug when player can access outside of the map.

Changes:

* New textures;
* Removed AWP's and added 2 assault suits;
* Added space by each door for camping.
