/// DE_FLORICANE - Bomb/Defuse
by Valentin C.-D. aka Fregira [valentin@dashquate.com]


/// SCENARIO

An eco-activist group plan to attack the headquarters of a big agrochemical firm based in Pinewood, CA. The facility include a warehouse where is stored a controversial fertilizer. The heavily protected safe room in the eastern wing of the facility shelters a couple of tanks of an experimental and potentially very hazardous herbicide.



/// OBJECTIVES

Terrorists : bomb one of the two targets (A: The storage area in the warehouse, B: The herbicide tanks in the safe house)
Counter-Terrorists: defend the facility and prevent the eco-activists from bombing the targets.

- Vulzacn for taking over Zoner's work and allowing us to make some beautiful maps using the good ol'GoldSrc Engine (and sparing us a lot of compilation time in the process)
- giMli (author of de_alps) for helping me with some good tips and convinced me it's possible to render an immersive atmosphere in a CS map.
- my girlfriend for supporting me and not complaining too much about me spending hours on her computer to finish that damn map.
- Valve Software, Minh Le and Jesse Cliffe and all of those who helped making this amazing game until 1.6... cause, obviously, the following versions were bullshit, yeah yeah even CSGO.
